I'm very new to all of this and looking for help. As I try to add image files to my project I seem to be getting many errors
I get stuck import_character_assets, specifically the character_path. I keep getting errors saying list index out of range. No variation
of the path, absolute or direct, will fix it. I've uploaded an image of how my files are sorted (listed as mario_style_graphics.png)
When I try to run the program this is the full list of errors I get. I am using Pycharm by the way. Thanks for any help or advice!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/Lauren/PycharmProjects/mario_style/main.py", line 11, in <module>
    level = Level(level_map, screen)
  File "C:\Users\Lauren\PycharmProjects\mario_style\level.py", line 11, in __init__
    self.setup_level(level_data)
  File "C:\Users\Lauren\PycharmProjects\mario_style\level.py", line 27, in setup_level
    player_sprite = Player((x, y), self.display_surface)
  File "C:\Users\Lauren\PycharmProjects\mario_style\player.py", line 11, in __init__
    self.image = self.animations['idle'][self.frame_index]
IndexError: list index out of range

If anyone had any advice, I feel like the error is looking at me in the face but like I said, I've tried different variations of 
things to get it to work. I am following the Creating a Platformer in Pygame by Clear Code tutorial on youtube. I got the images
from Clear Code here on github as well.
Thanks again!
